Techno Harp project's purpose is to allow users play any instrument sound with the use of water.

There are 2 modes for water enabling sound:
1. Using hairless-midiserial
1. Using Piezo speakers (buzzers)

Method 1 will require a call to playTone() function whereas

Method 2 will require a call to enableBuzzer() function.

There are also helpful debugging logs which can be enabled by setting DEBUG variable into 1.
