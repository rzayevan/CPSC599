# Techno Harp

Techno Harp project's purpose is to allow users play any instrument sound with the use of water.

## Techo Harp v1.0
The code has been cloned from https://github.com/madlabdk/touche

## Techo Harp v2.0

### Modes

There are 2 modes for water enabling sound:
1. Using hairless-midiserial
1. Using Piezo speakers (buzzers)

Method 1 will require a call to `playTone()` function whereas Method 2 will require a call to `enableBuzzer()` function.

### Debugging

There are also helpful debugging logs which can be enabled by setting `DEBUG` variable into `1`.
